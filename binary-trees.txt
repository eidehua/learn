A tree is a data structure that is composed of nodes, where each node is linked to a number of children, which are also nodes. 
A node is a data structure containing data, and arrows or "pointers" to its children. 
We can visualize the concept of this data structure of nodes as a tree. 
A binary tree is a tree where the max number of children per nodes is 2.

How can we visualize what a node is? 
A node for a binary tree stores three pieces of critical information: 
(1) data (of course, to be a data structure)
(2) left child (telling me how I can get to the left node)
(3) right child (telling me how I can get to the right node)

Binary tree algorithms:
Traversal
Search

Inorder predecessor
The inorder predecessor of node N is the right-most node in the left subtree
