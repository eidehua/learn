Min heap: Node value is less than or equal to every child
  Good use case: keeping track of top k values (from a stream of input)
    keep adding to heap until there are k entries
    After k entries, if next input value is < min, skip it
    If new value is > min, add in new value, and pop out the min which is in O(logk) time
Max heap: Node value is greater than or equal to every child
How to implement a heap

Think of a tree with an invariant placed on every node ( a property) that needs to be met for every node
